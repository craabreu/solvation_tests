PINY Tests
==========

The objective of this section is to test how the average properties of SPC/Fw water computed using
the SIN(R) method, as implemented in [PINY], vary with the size of the outer time step.

Some modifications were made to the original example available in [PINY]:

1. Box vectors were changed to produce a cubic box with side length of 24.68 angstroms.
